# Physiotherapy Chatbot using NLP ü§ñüßò‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è

Welcome to the **Physiotherapy Chatbot** project! This repository contains code and resources for an intelligent chatbot designed to assist users by providing information on various rehabilitation processes used by physiotherapists. This project leverages the power of Natural Language Processing (NLP) to understand user queries and deliver relevant responses.

## üåü Project Overview

This chatbot is an innovative solution aimed at enhancing the accessibility of physiotherapy information. By analyzing user input and matching it with a database of predefined questions and answers, the chatbot provides insightful and accurate responses. It's designed to be user-friendly, making it easy for anyone to interact and get the information they need.

## üõ†Ô∏è Key Features

- **Natural Language Processing**: Utilizes techniques such as tokenization, lemmatization, and stemming to process and understand text input.
- **Stopword Removal**: Filters out common words to focus on meaningful content.
- **TF-IDF Vectorization**: Converts text data into numerical format to enable efficient similarity calculations.
- **Cosine Similarity**: Measures the similarity between user input and stored questions to find the best response.
- **Dynamic Response Handling**: Refines answers based on the similarity score to provide precise and relevant information.

## üìö Tech Stack

- **Python**: Core programming language used for implementing the chatbot functionality.
- **NLTK**: A comprehensive library for NLP tasks, used for tokenizing, lemmatizing, stemming, and stopword removal.
- **scikit-learn**: Machine learning library utilized for vectorization (`TfidfVectorizer`) and similarity calculations (`cosine_similarity`).
- **NumPy**: A library for numerical operations, used to handle vector calculations efficiently.

## üìù How It Works

1. **Preprocessing**: The chatbot preprocesses user input by removing non-alphanumeric characters and filtering out stopwords.
2. **Vectorization**: Converts the cleaned text into a TF-IDF vector representation.
3. **Similarity Calculation**: Uses cosine similarity to compare user input against a set of predefined questions.
4. **Response Generation**: Returns the response corresponding to the most similar question, ensuring accurate and relevant information delivery.

## üìÇ Repository Structure

- `src/`: Contains the source code for the chatbot, including preprocessing functions and chatbot logic.
- `data/`: Includes sample datasets with predefined questions and answers for testing and demonstration purposes.
- `notebooks/`: Jupyter notebooks for experimenting with different NLP techniques and visualizations.
- `requirements.txt`: Lists all dependencies required to run the project.

## üöÄ Getting Started

1. **Clone the Repository**:  
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/physiotherapy-chatbot-nlp.git
   ```

2. **Install Dependencies**:  
   Navigate to the project directory and install the required Python packages:  
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. **Run the Chatbot**:  
   Execute the main script to start the chatbot and interact with it via the command line or integrate it into a web application using Flask.

## üìà Future Enhancements

- Integrate with a web-based interface for a more interactive user experience.
- Expand the database to include more comprehensive information on various physiotherapy techniques.
- Implement machine learning models to improve the chatbot's understanding and response accuracy.
